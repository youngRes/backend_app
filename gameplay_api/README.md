# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/gameplay/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/gameplay/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Building the Docker
 Please only rebuild the image if a commit have been made that needs rebuilding the image

```bash
# build the image
docker build -t "youngres_gameplay_api:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" .
# tag the image with the path in dockerHub
docker tag <image-id> "youngres/youngres_gameplay_api:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
# login into the youngres account
docker login
# upload the image to dockerHub
docker push "youngres/youngres_gameplay_api:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 youngres/youngres_gameplay_api:<version from dockerhub>
```
