## YOUNGRES GAME 1

# INSTRUCTIONS

To run this game we will only need to launch it with RPG Maker MV

If a new game is created and you want to replace the standard main menu (New Game, Load Game & Options) for the new one (Login, Load Chapter & Options) there are 2 options:

    1. Start a new project with RPG Maker MV and replace the files /data/rpg_scenes.json, /data/rpg_manager.js & /data/rpg_windows.js .
    2. Replace the same files in an existing game.

In adittion, the files /data/chapterInfo.json must be added and the file /data/system.json must be replaced.
