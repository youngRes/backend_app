By default, a portion of the ladder surrounding the current user will be displayed.

```
[xpladder]
```

To display the top 10 students instead of the neighbours of the current user, set the parameter `top`. You can optionally set the number of users to display like so `top=20`.

```
[xpladder top]
[xpladder top=15]
```

A link to the full ladder will automatically be displayed below the table, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

```
[xpladder hidelink]
```

By default, the table does not include the progress column which displays the progress bar. If such column has been selected in the additional colums in the ladder's settings, you can use the argument `withprogress` to display it.

```
[xpladder withprogress]
```

Note that when a course is using groups, the ladder will best guess which group to display the ladder of.

[xpiflevel <=10 >=20]
